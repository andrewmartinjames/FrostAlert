# ESP32
This folder will contain the (likely Arduino) code written for the Adafruit
Huzzah32 board (with an ESP32 microcontroller) connected to an Adafruit Ethernet
Featherwing (powered by a WIZ5500 chip) for stable internet and a DFRobot
SEN0385 temperature and humidity sensor (a repackaging of the Sensirion SHT31
chip) for remote sensing.
